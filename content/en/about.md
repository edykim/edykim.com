## My Name

My korean name is Yong Gyun Kim (김용균) and [Google speaks right way](https://translate.google.com/translate_tts?ie=UTF-8&q=%EA%B9%80%EC%9A%A9%EA%B7%A0&tl=ko&total=1&idx=0&textlen=3&tk=799460.701964&client=t&prev=input). I know my name is quite hard to speak for some people so you can call me Edward if you want to go easy.
