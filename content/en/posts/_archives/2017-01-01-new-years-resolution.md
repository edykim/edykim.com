I'd love to make a list. New year's resolution is one of the things, I almost
forget about it at the end of the year, though. I want to list some ideas for
2017:

- Keep writing a blog as much as I did last year. But the difference is that the
posts will be written by English.
- Read more. When I read something, it still very slow. Probably I will grab
Kindle again, want to spend more time with the text.
- Do coding. I didn't do anything with open source in last year because of the
translation. I want to make something.

This list is the three big things in this year. Will see what I can achieve at
the end.

Also, I want to mention here something, I didn't speak in public just yet. I got
an opportunity from somewhere else. The position is a quite different rather
than the current one. I need to digest new environments and also tech stacks.

It's almost 5 years since I moved in Melbourne. I always said that English is
the important if someone want to live here, but I didn't do any effort
during this period. I did some preparation for IELTS once, that study was not
intence at all because the goal was quite low points. In this time, I want to
study intensively. My expectation of this year is studying like a
[gosam](https://koreanteenlife.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/gosam/) does.

Practice makes perfect. Everyone knows that, most of people doesn't do that.
I will make it for the perfection with this resolution in this year.
