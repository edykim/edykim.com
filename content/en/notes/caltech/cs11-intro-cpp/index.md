This is a lecture note of CS-11 C++ track from Caltech. I summarized materials of Spring 2019-2020. The track detail is on the [CS11 C++ Track](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/) page.

## What I've Learned


I am familiar with the language a bit, so it was easy to follow the detail. The lecture explained some concepts deeply, which I enjoyed. The later tracks are mainly focused on the optimization and introduce the rules that I can utilize during the process.

- Building process (preprocessor, compiler, and linker)
- Basic of class and member functions
  - Declaration & definition
  - Access Modifier: `public`, `private`, `protected`
  - Accessors / mutators
  - Pass by value, pass by reference
  - Constructors
  - Operator overloading
- Difference between struct and class
- Scope
- C++ standard library - file I/O, `vector`, `string`
- Stream
- Heap memory
- The rule of Three, The rule of Five, The rule of Zero
- Member Initializer Lists
- Build tool `make`

Also, the lab materials were great to study the detail because it cames with testing suites.

## Lecture Summary


I made some notes when I was studying this track for later. These notes are too simplified and omitted some. I recommend checking the track slides at least once before seeing my notes.

- [Lecture 1](/note/cs-11-intro-cpp/lecture-1): Overview, compiler & build, classes
- [Lecture 2](/note/cs-11-intro-cpp/lecture-2): Build phase, structs & vector, exception handling
- [Lecture 3](/note/cs-11-intro-cpp/lecture-3): `fstream`, scope, pass by value/reference
- [Lecture 4](/note/cs-11-intro-cpp/lecture-4): GNU make, Doxygen
- [Lecture 5](/note/cs-11-intro-cpp/lecture-5): Operator overloading, Constructors, Output Stream
- [Lecture 6](/note/cs-11-intro-cpp/lecture-6): Copy and assignment operator with Heap, Inline
- [Lecture 7](/note/cs-11-intro-cpp/lecture-7): Copy and Move, The Rule of Five, Member Initializer Lists
