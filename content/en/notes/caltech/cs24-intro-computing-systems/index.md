This is a lecture note of CS24 from Caltech. I summarized materials of Fall 2019. The track detail is on the [CS24 Introduction to Computing Systems](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs24/19fa/) page.

## Lecture Summary


I made some notes when I was studying this track for later. These notes are too simplified and omitted some. I recommend checking the track slides at least once before seeing my notes.
