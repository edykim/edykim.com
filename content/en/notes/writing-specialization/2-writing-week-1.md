Short story related topic.

### Question

Sould be careful. Get to the point rather than asking rhetorical questions.

Don't use quotes that everyone knows.

Numbers can be boring. Don't use too common or too complated one.

## Sample Introduction Paragraph

1. Two years ago, John Smith was robbed at gun point while walking home from a movie theater. The thief took his money, watch, and cell phone. (Anecdote)
1. In high crime neighborhoods like his, this frequently happens. (Anecdote)
1. There are not enough police to protect innocent people walking home at night. (more specific)
1. Smallville needs more police to control gangs and drug users and to decrease violence. (Argument, very specific = Thesis statement)

## Thesis Statements

## Things to avoid

- Don't announce your thesis
  - I will talk about this ..., this essay is about ... (don't!)
- Dont't write a fact
  - should be arguable
- Don't write a popular opinion
  - if most of people agree with the opinion already, why argue about it?
- Don't use pronouns, be specific
  - Don't assume readers knows what you're talking about
- Don't forget the two parts
  - topic + controlling idea

## Sample Thesis Statements
