Coffee Recommendations in San Diego. [Suggestions are always welcome](https://forms.gle/VET6pUuCvMBfxE219).

- [Bird Rock Coffee Roasters](https://birdrockcoffee.com/):
  A coffee chain with locations throughout San Diego. Their medium-roast coffee with acidity is known as the Bird Rock Blend,
  but they also offer a variety of selections depending on the season and weather. Especially, their espresso tonic made with 
  bright beans is perfect for beating the summer heat.
- [Mnemonic Coffee](https://www.mnemonic.coffee)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/184cQaPG6WkndGAD8)):
  A cafe near Balboa Park. Their coffee is delicious, and their seasonal menus are truly unique.
- [Yipao Coffee](https://yipao-coffee.com/): One of the award-winning cafes from the SD Coffee Fair.
  Great with espresso drinks and offers pour-over options in various roast levels.
- [Wayfarer Bread & Pastry](https://www.wayfarerbread.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F4vumjC5AzVfsiVX6)):
  A famous bakery known for lines even before opening. They serve Sightglass coffee, which pairs wonderfully with their pastries.
  The pastry menu changes frequently and can be checked on their website.
- [Provecho! Coffee](https://provechocoffee.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w4KvfSiSai38ytti7)):
  The trendiest cafe I’ve visited in SD. The coffee is great, and the vibe feels like Brooklyn.
  The roast is on the darker side, but the coffee is well-balanced.
- [Dark Horse Coffee](https://www.darkhorsecoffeeroasters.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Luf8sdsyCA7ywvY46)):
  Visited the North Park location. They serve medium roast coffee with a good milk ratio and warm drinks.
  It’s a good spot to stop by before or after exploring the area.
- [Finjān Coffee Shop Co.](https://finjanco.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nibo2AQ8bMH9mLCz6)):
  Offers modernized Turkish-style coffee. Although they roast with James Coffee Roasters according to their own recipe,
  it's a pity that you can't purchase their beans directly. Unique items include Nutella Turkish coffee and orange cold brew.
  You can also enjoy crispy yet moist baklava true to a Turkish cafe.
- [Forum Coffee](https://www.forumcoffees.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3dCD26WtriY9yGzv7)):
  Their menu names are inspired by programming keywords, which is fun. They offer delicious and diverse coffee options.
  Always crowded and hard to find seating.
- [James Coffee Co.](https://jamescoffeeco.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F3Ew7a6XsrRN26gN8),
  [Location List](https://jamescoffeeco.com/pages/locations)):
  Another coffee chain found throughout San Diego. Offers balanced, well-executed coffee.
- [Hawthorn Coffee](https://www.hawthorncoffee.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/apUng4P9t6BbshRW7)):
  Great ambiance with tasty coffee and a comfortable menu.
- [Compa Coffee Roasters](https://www.compacoffeeroasters.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MFExVeuB7X1wukLX6)):
  Said to be a sister cafe to Hawthorn. Similar menu and vibe.
  Medium roast coffee pairs well with their easygoing menu. Good pour-over options and a tasty shakerato.
- [Communal Coffee](https://communalcoffee.com/)
  ([Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EK3mtUjaM8UYFB727)):
  Plenty of seating and stylish, clean interior. Coffee is decent and consistent.

## UTC Coffee

Since I live near UTC, I often go there for coffee. It’s a good walk and feels safe.

- Frequently Visited
  - La Colombe Coffee Roasters:
    Offers bottled water/sparkling water for a cleaner coffee experience. Stays true to the basics.
  - Blue Bottle Coffee:
    Used to go often, but it has been inconsistent lately. It seems to be focusing more on retail than taste nowadays.
- Cravings
  - 85C Bakery Cafe: Sometimes crave their sea salt coffee. Best with bread.
  - Starbucks: For days when you just want Starbucks or when seasonal menus are out.

## San Diego Airport 

- Dark Horse Coffee Roasters: Located in Terminal 1 near Gates 3–10. Great coffee and pretty good pastries.
  A bit of a hidden gem unless your Southwest flight is assigned to that gate.
  While there are other locations, it’s hard to find this level of coffee quality at the airport.
  - Note: Quality may drop a bit during busy holiday seasons due to high traveler volume.

## Not My Taste

Great cafes that just didn’t suit my personal preferences. A bit of a letdown.

- Jaunt Coffee Roasters: Nice location and vibe, always crowded, but the roast is quite dark and not to my liking.
- Rikka Fika: Aesthetically the most appealing place. If I ever opened a cafe, it’d look like this.
  I had high expectations and tried their pour-over, latte, and matcha drink, but was still left wanting more.
- The WestBean Coffee Roasters: Stopped by since it’s in front of the Costco I always go to.
  Despite being a medium roast, it lacked acidity. That said, the latte had a great milk ratio.
