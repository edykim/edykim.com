Great to have you here! Iâ€™m Edward who loves making new things on internet. This website is a small collection of my writings, interests, and bunch of memos (like personal websites during 00s!) I love to talk about web, open source, photography and coffee. Hope you find some useful things from here. 

Each page is very random and chaotic just like web in general. You can start from these pages: [about me](/about), [what I made](/crafts), and [some notes](/notes).

Enjoy!
