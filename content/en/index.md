Hello, I'm Edward. Great to have you here!
</h1>

I'm Edward, and I love creating new things on the internet. This website is a small collection of my writings, interests, and a bunch of memos (like personal websites from the 00s!). I enjoy talking about the web, open source, photography, and coffee. I hope you find something useful here!

Each page is random and chaotic, just like the web in general. You can start with these pages: [about me](/about), [what I made](/crafts), and [some notes](/notes).

Enjoy!
