<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.6rem;">Hello, I'm Edward.</p>

I'm an open web developer who loves focusing on problems and creating quick prototypes. I like to talk about web technology, software architecture, and community.

I'm an undergrad student at UC San Diego as a computer science major.

Previously, I had the chance to work with [Swinburne University](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/), [Kobe Creations](https://kobecreations.com/), and [Greenleaf Media](https://greenleafmedia.com/). You can find more details at [this page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardykim/).
