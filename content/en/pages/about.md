# Hello, I'm Edward.

I'm an open web developer who loves focusing on problems and creating quick prototypes. I like to talk about web technology, software architecture, and community.

Previously, I had the chance to work with [Swinburne University](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/) and [Kobe Creations](https://kobecreations.com/). You can find more details at [this page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardykim/).
