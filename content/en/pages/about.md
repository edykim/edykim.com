Hello, I'm Edward. I'm an open web developer who loves focusing on problems and creating quick prototypes. I'm excited to talk about web technology, software architecture, and community.

- Love to talk about ECMAScript, microservices, serverless architecture
- Comfortable with JS, Python, PHP, HTML/CSS, and C#
- Passionate about solving complexities and problems
- Community Manager at [weirdx.io](http://weirdx.io)

I am originally from Jeju, South Korea, and am studying computer science in Riverside, CA. I'm happy to discuss new opportunities.

Before moving to the U.S., I worked at [Swinburne University](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/) and [Kobe Creations](https://kobecreations.com/) in Melbourne, Australia. You can find more detail on [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardykim/).
