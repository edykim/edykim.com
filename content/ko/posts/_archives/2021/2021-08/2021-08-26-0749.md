([Rowena Tsai - 7 life changing mindset habits to soothe the anxious soul & live lighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmBRB2Wq8VU))

1. Your world = what you choose to fixate as on
    - think about me - surround world - "world" world - spritiual world
2. "People are in our life for a reason, season, or lifetime. The pain comes when we put them in the wrong category"
3. You're never too \[fill in the blank\] for anything
    - negative self-talk and/or judgemental mindset = projecting insecurity + hurting others and myself
    - "We notice a lot of dislikable people but we never seem to notice our disliking minds" -- Buddha
4. Don't wait to start living the life you want to live
    - Define first. What is the type of life you want to live?
    - What you need to do for that life? What can you do?
5. "No one is going to move my leg but me"
    - We are responsible for ourselves, own lives
6. Instant vs. delayed gratification (ft. cancel culture)
    - extension of "Short-term satisfaction vs. long-term fulfillment"
    - Immediate feeling/judgement are not helpful (social media, cancel culture)
7. Only we know where our love truly lie
    - Truthfulness, compassion, forbearance
