# Desktop Setup

## Installation

Download iso file of ubuntu from near mirror site. Generally, ISP and universities provide sort of mirror services. Then, create a USB stick for installation.

- [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)
- [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) for windows

Plug the stick and boot the system. If it doesn't recognise the stick, you need to change boot order from BIOS.

After Ubuntu screen is displayed, follow the instruction on the screen.

## Language

Add new language from "Language Support". Then, add new input sources from "settings > Language and Region."

## Font size

Still, most of laptops offer quite low resolution. If the size of font is not small enough, [gnome-tweak-tool](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-tweak-tool) gives an option for changing scaling factor.
Also, this tool gives a several options for gnome, so check the detail on the menu and change it.

Open "Tweaks > Fonts", Then change `Scaling Factor` at the last.
